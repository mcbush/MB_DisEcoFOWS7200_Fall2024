**1)** Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

**A:** 29-59

**2)** Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios:\
**a)** 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

**A:** 294\
**b)** 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

**A:** 226\

**3)** You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you\
are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is

**A:** \<1%.\

**4)** \
**a)** Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county. Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.

**A:**

Chambers: Prevalence: 0.267, Lower CL: 0.131, Upper CL: 0.449

Lee: Prevalence: 0.200, Lower CL: 0.143, Upper CL: 0.273

Russell: Prevalence: 0.031, Lower CL: 0.009, Upper CL: 0.087\

**b)** Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test.

**A:**

Chambers: 26.7%

Lee: 20%

Russell: 3.1%

Two-Sided P Value: \<0.0001

**5)**

**a)** Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.

**A:**

Day1: 3/57 x 100 = 5.26% incidence

Day2: 4/56 x 100 = 7.14% incidence

Day5: 20/40 x 100 = 50% incidence

\
**b)** What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?

**A:**

Day3: 11.66%

Day 5: 33.33%

\
**c)** On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

Day 0\
