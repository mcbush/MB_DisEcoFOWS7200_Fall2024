```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

![The environment, host, and pathogen triad is a framework used to understand disease dynamics. The environment includes factors like climate, geography, and living conditions that influence disease spread. The host is the individual or population susceptible to the disease, affected by genetics, health, and behavior. The pathogen is the microorganism causing the disease, which might be bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Delving into how these three components interact helps in devising effective strategies for disease prevention and control.](EpiTriad.png)
